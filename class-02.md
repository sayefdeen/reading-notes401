# Classes, Inheritance, Functional Programming

## Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?

JaaScript is a ront-end language which can minipulate the DOM, create events and such more thing, but all these things are happening in the browser.

So what if we want to call an API and get a specific data from it, or connect a data base to get some information about a user for example using JavaScript language, here come the need for **Node.js** which it was designed to build scalable network aplications.

## What is the difference between a module and a package?

- A module is a single javaScript file that has some funciton on it.

- A package is a directory with one or more modules inside of it and a pacakge.json file which has metadata about the package.

## What does the node package manager do?

Node Package Manager [(npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/), it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects, and it is a commind-line utility for package installation.

```cmd
npm install <pacakge name>
```

## Provide code snippets showing 3 different ways to export a function from a node module

exports is an object, So it exposes whatever you assigned to it as a module.

1. Export Literals:

```javascript
// Exporting this from message.js
module.exports = 'Any String'
// import message.js into another file
const message = require('path to message.js');
console.log(message) => 'Any String'
```

2. Exporting Objects

The exports is an object. So, you can attach properties or methods to it

```javascript
// Exporting this from message.js
module.exports.SimpleText = 'Hello world!';
module.exports.print = function(msg){
    console..log(msg);
}
// import message.js into another file
const message = require('path to message.js');
console.log(message.SimpleText);
message.print('this is a test')  // this will console log => this is a test
// So message is an object and SimpleText is a property of that object
```

3. Export Function as a Class

In JavaScript, a function can be treated like a class.

<p>Exporting from message.js</p>

```javascript
module.exports = function (firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
  this.fullName = function () {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  };
};
```

<p>Importing to app.js</p>

```javascript
var person = require('./Person.js');

var person1 = new person('James', 'Bond');

console.log(person1.fullName());
```
