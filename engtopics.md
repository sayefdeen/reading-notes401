## 1. Solving Problems.

Steps for every programming problem

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

### Read the problem completely twice.

You have to make sure that you understand the problems, if you don't understand the problem you cannot solve it, the more time you spend in this step the better because the more you understand it the faster you gonna solve it.

### Solve the problem manually.

<p style="color:red">Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!</p>

It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around. Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.

It’s very important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem. You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head. You want to be aware of each step, it is easy to gloss over them.

### Optimize the manual solution.

It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state, trying to figure out if there is another way to solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you cut our simplify.

### Write pseudo-code or comments.

You can skip thie step if you have a really good handle on the problem, or your previous steps already created a detailed enough to descripte the solution.

By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.

### Replace comments with real code.

This step should be extremely easy at this point. If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.

If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

- You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps
- You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion

### Optimize the real code.

Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names, having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.

## 2. Pretend Your Time is Worth \$1,000/Hour.

- You have a few hours in this life, so make sure to invest well on them so you can achieve your goals, cause this will affect your future self.

- There is difference between focusing and just being busy all the time. When you’re busy, you are on autopilot. You can’t see the hours slipping away, time you’ll never get back.

- Don't let anyone to be on charge of your time and how you manage it, if you don't manage your time, it will manage you.

- People will get used to the the fact that your time is viliable to you, they will recognize it,recpect it,and will treat you differently.

- If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired.

- Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.
