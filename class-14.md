# Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

  - Basic Authorization : used when we want to generate a new token for a new user

  - Bearer Authorization : used to check if the token for already registered user is correct

- What does the JSON Web Token package do?

It can generate a token for any user, and it can check if the generated token is correct of not.

- What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

The secrete should not be shared, because any one have the secrete and the user name/ id for an example can generate the token and go to that user page.

## Vocabulary

- **encryption** : encryption is the process of encoding information. This process converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information.

- **token** : a string generated fro JWT let us check if the user is authorized to use this part of the website of not
- **bearer** : is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
- **secret** : is a private string which used to generate a token, is should not revealed.
- **JSON Web Token** : is an Internet standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key

## Preparation Materials

[RBAC] is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization.

The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs.

Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

### RBAC vs. ABAC vs. ACL

- **Access control lists (ACL)** — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document

- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)** — ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc.

Both of these options provide additional granularity of controls beyond the basic concept of RBAC, but can also greatly expand the effort required to create and maintain the necessary permissions. RBAC arguably offers a more simplified and manageable approach, given that the privileges of a user in a given position are granted with a simple effort, to all others in the same role. These methods can, however, be used in tandem to increase control.

### RBAC implementation

1. Inventory your systems : Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. Examples would include an email system, customer database, contact management system, major folders on a file server, etc.

2. Analyze your workforce and create roles : You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs. Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined. Keep them as simple and stratified as possible.

3. Assign people to roles : Now that you have a list of roles and their access rights, figure out which role(s) each employee belongs in, and set their access accordingly.

4. Never make one-off changes : Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. If you begin doing this, your RBAC system will quickly begin to unravel. Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary.

5. Audit : Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each.
